The singer, on the other hand, flaunted her long legs in a sequined silver skirt with a thigh-high split, white t-shirt, silver belt, leather jacket, and see-through heels.</p><p class=dh>“I told @realtamiaworld that I was the leading man in @willpowerpacker NEW movie @whatmenwant... I don't think she believed me but she came to the LA premiere with me anyway,” Hill <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BtOeUwZhhfn/>captioned</a> the post.</p><p class=dh>And continued:</p><p class=dh>“Thank you to @willpowerpacker for the cameo love, and for keeping me off of the edit room floor lol. And to the great @adamshankman too. I was there at the premiere last night (in the last row)...”</p><p class=dh>The movie, starred by Taraji P. Henson, is the new, improved version of Mel Gibson’s 2000 film “What Women Want,” and it also features cameos from other NBA personalities like Shaquille O’Neal and Karl Anthony-Halls.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>MAKING IT WORK WITH A BUSY SCHEDULE</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Tamia proved, once again, that family comes first by taking time from her busy agenda to attend her husband’s debut in the big screen. The Canadian born songstress is currently getting ready to resume her tour “Passion Like Fire,” as she promotes her latest album of the same name.</p><p class=dh>After visiting most of the major US cities, Tamia is now headed to Europe and South Africa in the next months, leaving her husband and their daughters, Myla Grace Hill, 16, and Lael Rose Hill, 10, behind.</p><p class=dh>Talking about she juggles motherhood, marriage, and her career, Tamia <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://travelgirlinc.com/tamia-grant-hill-love-songs-basketball/>revealed</a> to Travel Girl that her family’s support has been essential for her to accomplish all of her dreams. And added:</p><p class=dh>“There is a comfort knowing that when I’m traveling and performing, home is taken care of. It is a running joke within my camp that as soon as Tamia says “good night,” if I can get a flight, I walk off the stage onto a plane. I make it work. I prioritize, and I love home; I want to be home with Grant and my children as much as possible.”</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>THE SECRET BEHIND A </strong><strong class=bh>SUCCESSFUL</strong><strong class=bh> MARRIAGE</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Tamia and Grant have been <a class="me a" href=#>married for 19 years</a> and are considered one of the biggest examples of what “black love” should be in the entertainment industry. But when asked about their secret to keeping a healthy, long-lasting marriage, they agree that there’s not a secret formula and it works differently for every couple.</p><p class=dh>“I really think every relationship is different and the dynamics within every relationship are different. You have to continue to adapt and adjust and find out what works for the two of you,” Hill <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://travelgirlinc.com/tamia-grant-hill-love-songs-basketball/>explained</a>.</p><p class=dh>“We were just talking about how people were asking just these deep questions, and we were like, at the end of the day, it’s not deep,” Tamia <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/celebrity/black-celeb-couples/tamia-husband-grant-hill-marriage-advice/>told</a> Essence. “Marriage is not deep. It isn’t complicated; you’re just trying to make it.”</p><p class=dh>For the “Into You” singer, is not about looking into each other’s eyes, but looking in the same direction.</p><p class=dh>Both stars encourage couples to find what works best for them, all while keeping the lines of communication and honesty open.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpqam9kZXqovsCnq2agmaG5bsPIn5xmrJGitqJ5066pp2WYmq6lv4ycpqWnomKwb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elaine-andriejanssen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Her Bio &amp;amp; Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./george-reeves-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>George Reeves Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./277658-aj-johnson-aka-sharane-house-party-once-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./49ers-vaunted-defense-shredded-by-kirk-cousins-vikings.html>49ers vaunted defense shredded by Kirk Cousins, Vikings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./basketball-player-liangelo-ball-and-love-hip-hop-star-nikki-mudarris-expecting-first-child-together-photos.html>Basketball star LiAngelo Ball and Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop celebrity Nikki Mudarris are expecting their first</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-jeter-wont-actually-play-at-yankees-old-timers-day.html>Derek Jeter won't actually play at Yankees Old-Timers' Day</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./duct-tape-bikini-model-suffers-wardrobe-malfunction-during-nyfw.html>Duct tape bikini model suffers wardrobe malfunction during NYFW</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog.
