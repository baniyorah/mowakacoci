He first appeared in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace as the apprentice of Darth Sidious and the enemy of the Jedi. He wielded a double-bladed lightsaber and fought with incredible skill and agility. He killed Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn in a fierce duel, but was seemingly killed himself by Qui-Gon’s Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who cut him in half and sent him tumbling down a reactor shaft.</p><p>However, as many Star Wars fans know, Darth Maul did not die that day. He survived his injuries and returned in various forms of media, including animated series, comics, novels, and even a live-action film. But how did he survive, and what happened to him after his apparent death? In this article, we will explore the surprising fate of Darth Maul, from his resurrection to his final demise.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Darth Maul’s Resurrection</h2><p>According to the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Darth Maul survived his fall by using the dark side of the Force to cling to life. He ended up on the junk planet Lotho Minor, where he was found by a snake-like creature called Morley, who gave him a mechanical spider-like apparatus to replace his lower half. Maul also lost his sanity and his memory, living in a state of madness and rage for over a decade.</p><p>Maul’s brother, Savage Opress, a Nightbrother from Dathomir, was sent by the Nightsister Mother Talzin to find and rescue him. Opress followed a trail of clues and eventually located Maul on Lotho Minor, where he recognized him despite his horrific condition. Opress brought Maul back to Dathomir, where Mother Talzin used her dark magic to restore his mind and body. She gave him a new pair of cybernetic legs and a new purpose: to seek revenge against Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Sith.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Darth Maul’s Revenge</h2><p>Darth Maul and Savage Opress embarked on a quest to find and kill Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was now a Jedi Knight and a general in the Clone Wars. They attacked several Republic outposts and killed many Jedi, hoping to lure Kenobi into a trap. They eventually faced him on the planet Raydonia, where they also encountered Asajj Ventress, a former Sith apprentice and a bounty hunter. The two Jedi and the two Sith fought in a fierce battle, but Maul and Opress were forced to retreat when more Republic forces arrived.</p><p>Maul and Opress then sought to build their own army and challenge both the Jedi and the Sith. They allied themselves with various criminal organizations, such as the Black Sun, the Pyke Syndicate, and the Hutt Cartel, forming a coalition called the Shadow Collective. They also staged a coup on the planet Mandalore, overthrowing the pacifist government of Duchess Satine Kryze and installing the former Death Watch leader Pre Vizsla as the new ruler. However, Maul soon betrayed and killed Vizsla, claiming the title of Mandalore and the Darksaber, a unique weapon that symbolized the leadership of the Mandalorians.</p><p>Maul’s actions attracted the attention of his former master, Darth Sidious, who saw him as a rival and a threat. Sidious traveled to Mandalore and confronted Maul and Opress, engaging them in a brutal duel. Sidious proved to be too powerful for the brothers, killing Opress and capturing Maul. Sidious tortured Maul and intended to use him as a pawn in his plans, but Maul managed to escape with the help of the Mandalorian super commandos loyal to him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Darth Maul’s Survival</h2><p>Darth Maul continued to lead the Shadow Collective, but faced opposition from both the Republic and the Separatists, who saw him as a common enemy. He also had to deal with the betrayal of some of his allies, such as the Pykes and the Hutts, who switched sides or abandoned him. He also faced the wrath of General Grievous, the leader of the Separatist droid army and another Sith apprentice of Sidious, who attacked his base on Zanbar and destroyed most of his forces.</p><p>Maul retreated to Dathomir, where he sought the help of Mother Talzin, who revealed herself to be his biological mother. She planned to use Maul as a conduit to drain the life force of Darth Sidious and reclaim her former power. However, their plan was foiled by the arrival of Sidious, Grievous, and Count Dooku, another Sith apprentice and the leader of the Separatists. A fierce battle ensued, in which Mother Talzin sacrificed herself to save Maul, who barely escaped with a few of his loyalists.</p><p>Maul went into hiding, but resurfaced after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire. He reorganized the remnants of his criminal empire and renamed it Crimson Dawn, becoming a powerful and elusive crime lord. He also acquired a new apprentice, Dryden Vos, who served as the public face of Crimson Dawn. Maul also trained another protégé, Qi’ra, who was the former lover of Han Solo and the leader of the White Worms gang on Corellia.</p><p>Maul made a brief appearance in the film Solo: A Star Wars Story, where he contacted Qi’ra via hologram after she killed Dryden Vos and took over his position. He ordered her to join him on Dathomir, where he intended to make her his new right hand. He also revealed his lightsaber to her, implying that he was still a Force user and a threat to the Empire.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Darth Maul’s Demise</h2><p>Darth Maul’s final fate was revealed in the animated series Star Wars Rebels, which took place about five years before the events of Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope. Maul encountered a young Jedi named Ezra Bridger, who was part of a rebel cell called the Spectres. Maul manipulated Ezra into helping him find a Sith holocron, an ancient device that contained dark side secrets. He also tried to lure Ezra to the dark side, claiming that he could be his new apprentice and teach him how to defeat the Sith.</p><p>Maul and Ezra used the Sith holocron and a Jedi holocron to access a vision that would reveal the answers to their questions. Maul wanted to know the identity of the Sith Lord who orchestrated the fall of the Jedi and the Republic, while Ezra wanted to know how to destroy the Sith. However, their vision was incomplete and vague, only showing them two words: “Twin Suns”. Maul interpreted this as a clue to the location of his old nemesis, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who he believed was the key to destroying the Sith. He also learned that Kenobi was protecting someone important, possibly the Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force.</p><p>Maul tracked down Kenobi on the desert planet Tatooine, where he had been living in exile for years, watching over the young Luke Skywalker. Maul confronted Kenobi and challenged him to a final duel, hoping to avenge his past defeats and his brother’s death. However, Kenobi easily defeated Maul, striking him down with a single blow. As he lay dying in Kenobi’s arms, Maul asked him if the person he was guarding was the Chosen One. Kenobi confirmed this, and Maul expressed his hope that this person would avenge them both. Maul then died peacefully, ending his long and tragic life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfnsBusMCrq6FlnZbCrXnDnpidZaSdsm6%2F1Kunq6GjnruoecWaq55ln5t6tbTEZqqirJhiubC%2Bw2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gwendoline-christie-married-partner-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Gwendoline Christie Married?
