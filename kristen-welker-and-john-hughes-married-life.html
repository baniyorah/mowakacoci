What did he do? He made her laugh.&nbsp;</p><p>After some dates, John and Kristen were pronounced husband and wife in some extravagant wedding ceremony. Want to know more about the love birds? If yes, then read along.</p><h2>Making her Laugh Works Like a Charm!</h2><p>In her late 30s, when all of her friends were having babies, Welker found it very difficult to find the right guy to spend the rest of her life with. Kristen works at <i>NBC</i> as a White House Correspondent, which requires long hours of work; maybe that made it more difficult for her dating life.</p><p>The <i>October of 2014</i>, however, bought the good news for her in the form of her best friend, <strong>Laura Nagle</strong>, who set up her on a romantic date with<strong> John Hughes</strong>. John serves as a marketing director at <i>Merck, </i>a multinational pharmaceutical company in <i>Philadelphia</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/20/1789%20Restaurant-1571547722719.JPG><p>Welker went to Philly to meet him, and he impressed her right off the bat. John did all the generous things a man can do for his woman, but at the same time, he got a little intimated by her. After some nervous talk, John got more relaxed and <a href=#>made her laugh plenty of times.</a> Afterward, their conversation went smoothly, and they talked for the whole night.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Wedding Proposal</h2><p>Hughes faced some challenges while proposing to his lover. During their six months of dating, John traveled a lot to wherever Kristen went as part of her work. He occasionally flew&nbsp;to just spent a few hours with his love of life.</p><p>After years of dating, John decided to take his relationship to the next level. So, he took Welker to Lincoln Memorial steps and then grabbed her hands while saying all the romantic words; finally, he concluded with a big question, "Will you Marry Me?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/20/Romantic%20gateway-1571548027878.JPG><p>With tears in her eyes, Welker said, 'Yes,' and now the couple had to prepare for their big day.</p><h2>Kristen Welker, "I Do"</h2><p>For the big day, the pair booked a place at the <i>Hyatt</i> at the <i>Bellevue Hotel</i> on <i>March 4, 2017</i>. The venue was filled with the duo's family members, friends, and colleagues. Kristen's friends from <i>NBC</i> <a href=#><strong>Andrea Canning</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=#><strong>Laura Garcia</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Katy Blakey</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kelly O'Donnell</strong></a><strong>, Chuck Todd</strong>, and <strong>Pete Williams</strong>, to name a few, also attended the matrimony.</p><p>Amid all the guests, Welker walked down the aisle in her strapless ivory vera wang gown, which she bought with her mother. The atmosphere in the venue was very hearty as everyone was frequently smiling and talking about how happy the bride looked.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/20/12VOWS-slide-W6BK-jumbo-1571548261336.jpg><p>The pair shared a romantic kiss as the reverend pronounced them as husband and wife. The ceremony ended with a fantastic after-party as all the guests, including the bride and groom, enjoyed a dance.</p><p><i><strong>For further updates, keep reading </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a><i><strong>!!! &nbsp;</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqSpoqukmrtuw8Slop6qXZa7pXnJqJ%2BnZZiqtKmx0makmqqinrKlecuinZ4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./93241-donny-osmond-asks-fans-pray-brother-life-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Marie Osmond asks for prayers after brother is placed on life support</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kelli-giddish-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kelli Giddish Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./277658-aj-johnson-aka-sharane-house-party-once-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./49ers-vaunted-defense-shredded-by-kirk-cousins-vikings.html>49ers vaunted defense shredded by Kirk Cousins, Vikings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./basketball-player-liangelo-ball-and-love-hip-hop-star-nikki-mudarris-expecting-first-child-together-photos.html>Basketball star LiAngelo Ball and Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop celebrity Nikki Mudarris are expecting their first</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-jeter-wont-actually-play-at-yankees-old-timers-day.html>Derek Jeter won't actually play at Yankees Old-Timers' Day</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./duct-tape-bikini-model-suffers-wardrobe-malfunction-during-nyfw.html>Duct tape bikini model suffers wardrobe malfunction during NYFW</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog.
