Skov later spoke about her aunt's reaction to her participation and support.</p><p class=dh>Lark Skov was among several contestants, each related to well-known celebrities on "Claim to Fame."Some of them had fake names to conceal their identities, commuting in the same house as they played to win the $100,000 prize.</p><p class=dh>Skov had many of them believing she was related to Martha Stewart and managed to ride that trail until she was found to be Cindy Crawford's niece in the second to last episode. But while her TV appearance was entertaining, Skov's life offscreen has been just as interesting.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Cindy Crawford's Niece Is a College Graduate</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Skov attended the University of Washington, where she majored in Linguistics. During her time there, she was a part of the school's women's rowing team and competed throughout her tuition and even after.</p><p class=dh>In May 2021, her team beat California at the Windermere Cup Regatta. Skov posted a photo from the momentous event of her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/COWa6B0F4mO/><u>team members celebrating</u></a> and holding their cups up triumphantly. She shared another of them <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CPhetIpF-tq/><u>in action</u></a> later that month.</p><p class=dh>Among other notable achievements she attained as a college rower is a bronze medal from the U.S. women's eight at the 2019 World Rowing Under 23 Championships. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://gohuskies.com/sports/womens-rowing/roster/lark-skov/12025>graduated from USW</a> in 2020 and has shared little glimpses of her life <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/sharkthelark/><u>on social media</u></a>.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Lark Skov on Her Experience in 'Claim to Fame'</strong></h2></p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#><u>Keke Palmer</u></a>'s sister, Loreal "LC" Palmer, won season one of "Claim to Fame."

In one episode, Skov did a lie-detector challenge where she was asked if her celebrity relative was friends with <a class="me a" href=#><u>Snoop Dogg</u></a>.</p><p class=dh>Although she was unsure, she replied no, and Crawford later texted her pictures with the rapper. "I guess you didn't know I was tight with Snoop," Crawford jokingly <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.newsweek.com/claim-fame-lark-cast-logan-cindy-crawford-niece-relation-finale-who-1739852><u>wrote</u></a> to her niece.
