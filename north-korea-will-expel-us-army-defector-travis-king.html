Please respect our privacy!”</p><p>The front porch was also decorated with an American flag – which was hung with the blue field on the viewer’s right side, which is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">technically a violation of US code</a>.</p><p>“Ms. Gates will be forever grateful to the United States Army and all its interagency partners for a job well done,” family spokesperson Jonathan Franks wrote in a statement.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">King (in the black hat) was seen touring the Demilitarized Zone in South Korea before crossing the border. <span class=credit>AP Photo/Sarah Jane Leslie</span></figure><p>“For the foreseeable future, the family asks for privacy, and Ms. Gates does not intend to give any interviews.”</p><p>North Korea previously claimed that the young soldier — who was facing disciplinary action following a series of dust-ups in South Korea — defected because he was bitter over poor treatment and racism within the US forces.</p><p>King had been recently released from a South Korean prison and was set to fly back to the US when he slipped his military escort and was later caught on film at a tour of the Joint Security Area — the border village in the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas that is guarded by soldiers from both sides — on July 18.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">According to officials, King entered North Korea because he “harbored ill feelings against inhuman mistreatment and racial discrimination within the US Army.” <span class=credit>VIA REUTERS</span></figure><p>“To our right, we hear a loud HA-HA-HA and one guy from OUR GROUP that has been with us all day runs in between two of the buildings and over to the other side!!” Swedish tourist Mikaela Johansson wrote of the moment the private second class — who was dressed in civilian clothes — dashed across the border into North Korea.</p><p>US officials later confirmed that King made a “deliberate decision” to cross into the infamously isolated Communist country.</p><p>A few weeks later, the Pentagon declined to grant the Wisconsin native prisoner of war status, but still insisted that he be “treated humanely in accordance with international law.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">King reportedly wanted to seek refuge in North Korea or another country. <span class=credit>AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon</span></figure><p>North Korea finally confirmed that King was detained in the Hermit Kingdom in mid-August — and alleged that he fled there because he was “disillusioned at the unequal American society.”</p><p>At the time, the US military declined to verify the 23-year-old’s allegations of mistreatment and discrimination by Army higher-ups, CBS News reported.</p><p>King’s apparent attempt at defection was not his first brush with trouble: A few months before the bizarre bolt, he pleaded guilty to charges of assault and destruction of public property related to two violent incidents in Seoul in the fall of 2022 — including one in which he did $460 in damage to a police patrol car.</p><p>He was fined $3,950 by the Seoul Western District Court and was also facing disciplinary action from the US military.</p><p>King’s bewildered family said his recent behavior may be linked to the death of his 7-year-old cousin, who passed away last winter from a rare genetic disorder.</p><p>“When my son was on life support, and when my son passed away … Travis started [being] reckless [and] crazy when he knew my son was about to die,” King’s uncle, Carl Gates, told the Daily Beast.</p><p>The soldier’s mother insisted that her son was loyal to the US and deserved to come home.</p><p>“I’m so proud of him. I just want him to come home, come back to America,” Gates told ABC News.</p><p>There is currently a State Department travel ban on North Korea, which was put in place when American college student Otto Warmbier was detained by authorities during a tour of the country in 2015.</p><p>The University of Virginia student was released and returned to the US in a coma in 2017, and died shortly thereafter.</p><p>With Post wires</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma29fo7yzwMdmoqiqlZZ6uLXLpWSesKCauW7B0maYq6WpYrGmssScq6iqXam%2FosLIrGSkoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pete-davidson-tells-peta-to-suck-my-d-k-over-new-dog-in-phone-rant.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pete Davidson tells PETA to 'suck my d--k' over new dog in phone rant</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./knicks-donte-divincenzo-eyeing-spot-on-italian-olympic-team.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Knicks' Donte DiVincenzo eyeing spot on Italian Olympic team</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./277658-aj-johnson-aka-sharane-house-party-once-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./49ers-vaunted-defense-shredded-by-kirk-cousins-vikings.html>49ers vaunted defense shredded by Kirk Cousins, Vikings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./basketball-player-liangelo-ball-and-love-hip-hop-star-nikki-mudarris-expecting-first-child-together-photos.html>Basketball star LiAngelo Ball and Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop celebrity Nikki Mudarris are expecting their first</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-jeter-wont-actually-play-at-yankees-old-timers-day.html>Derek Jeter won't actually play at Yankees Old-Timers' Day</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./duct-tape-bikini-model-suffers-wardrobe-malfunction-during-nyfw.html>Duct tape bikini model suffers wardrobe malfunction during NYFW</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog.
