The "Rush Hour" star had his son with him the entire time, welcomed his son into the world back in 1998 with his then-wife Azja Pryor. Since then, their son Destin Christopher would rarely be seen out in the spotlight, and this occasion is one of the few times.</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>Father and Son Time</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg>Aside from the Tarantino movie, the father-and-son duo also attended the Chopard Party together the week prior, and back in December during the Captain Planet Foundation's annual Benefit Gala in Atlanta.
