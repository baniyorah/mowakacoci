Prior to that, the New York City <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/tv-radio-obituaries/5225791/Beatrice-Arthur.html>native</a> did a series of Broadway plays.</p><p class=dh>Arthur's film career includes1970's "Lovers and Other Strangers," 1981's "Mel Brooke's History of the World: Part 1," and 1995's "For Better or Worse."</p><p class=dh>In her personal life, Arthur was married to Robert Alan Arthur from 1947 to 1950 and then to Gene Saks from 1950 to 1980. When she died in 2009, she left behind two sons, Matthew and Daniel Saks.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>A quick look at Betty White's career and personal life</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Betty White was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/betty-white-6704.php>born in</a> Oak Park, Illinois. In addition to being one of the funniest actresses still alive, she was also a producer and game show host.</p><p class=dh>The diverse talent that is White got her start in radio commercials before she went into singing. Her break came in the 40s with tv appearances on shows like "Blondie" and "This Is Your FBI."</p><p class=dh>By 1949, White took on hosting before founding a production company in 1952. Her three husbands were Dick Barker, Lane Allen, and Allen Ludden.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/2eece2250764e59f28cc6164c2ef94ab8204291571340054.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Betty White attends the TMA 2015 Heller Awards in Century City, California on May 28, 2015 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Rue McClanahan compares the actresses to their characters</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>In a clip uploaded <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3cnqPttN3o&feature=youtu.be">in 2010</a>, Rue McClanahan spoke about herself and her former co-stars on "The Golden Girls" and revealed whether or not they were anything like the characters on the show.</p><p class=dh>She started with herself:</p><p class=dh>"Get serious. Just look at the fact. Blanche is a man-crazy, glamorous, extremely sexy and successful southern belle from Atlanta Georgia - and I'm not from Atlanta."</p><p class=dh>McClanahan went on to explain that White was "least" like her character. Although her real-life personality was quick-witted like Rose, that was about it in terms of similarities.</p><p class=dh>The 2006 revelation probably won't bother loyal "Golden Girls" fans. And although McClanahan was married six times, we'll give her the benefit of the doubt regarding her claims.</p><p class=dh>Sadly, McClanahan died in 2010 at age 76. She left behind only one son, Mark Bish. Getty was 84 when she passed away in 2008. Meanwhile, White is still living up to her "Golden Girl" name with her witty humor at 97.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpub29ibnq1tMRmnqiklJq7brPIq6OsZZOWwLV506Gcoqpdp7KiuIyloK%2Bdo2Kwb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-kfc-watermelon-by-lil-al-saeed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Meaning Behind The Song: KFC Watermelon by LIL AL SAEED</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tawny-dahl-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tawny Dahl Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./277658-aj-johnson-aka-sharane-house-party-once-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./49ers-vaunted-defense-shredded-by-kirk-cousins-vikings.html>49ers vaunted defense shredded by Kirk Cousins, Vikings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./basketball-player-liangelo-ball-and-love-hip-hop-star-nikki-mudarris-expecting-first-child-together-photos.html>Basketball star LiAngelo Ball and Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop celebrity Nikki Mudarris are expecting their first</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-jeter-wont-actually-play-at-yankees-old-timers-day.html>Derek Jeter won't actually play at Yankees Old-Timers' Day</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./duct-tape-bikini-model-suffers-wardrobe-malfunction-during-nyfw.html>Duct tape bikini model suffers wardrobe malfunction during NYFW</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog.
