Among them, playing Charlie in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is definitely his most iconic role.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In the modern spin-off of the famous Psycho horror&nbsp;franchise, the actor can be seen sharing an intimate moment in one of the show's pivotal moments.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The bold scene also has garnered substantial interest in Highmore's sexuality, with more than a few people questioning if he was gay. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Freddie Highmore In An Intimate Gay Scene&nbsp;'Bates Motel'</h2><p>In Bates Motel, Freddie Highmore plays the infamous serial killer Norman Bates, once portrayed with disturbing accuracy by Anthony Perkins in legendary director Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Psycho.</p><p>Over the years, many actors have embodied the killer's character, each adding their element of evil and nuances to Bates. But none have outdone Highmore when it comes to exploring the "Psycho's" sexuality&nbsp;in&nbsp;Bates Motel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>While the character's sexuality isn't explicitly defined in the<span> show, Its&nbsp;</span>last season makes some shocking revelations.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span>Much to the fans'&nbsp;surprise, Highmore's Norman even shares a kiss with another man in Season 5.&nbsp;This is surprising because in all of Norman Bates's previous iterations, not once has he been revealed to be gay.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span>Moreover, throughout the five seasons of the hit A&E production,&nbsp;Bates is portrayed as a&nbsp;straight man who passionately&nbsp;talks about sleeping&nbsp;with women and aggressively rejects gay advances.</span></p><p>By the end of the season, audiences <strong>(spoiler alert)</strong> also found out&nbsp;that after killing his mom in the Season 4 finale, Norman started&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dress&nbsp;up</a> as the deceased mother to pick up men at gay bars. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This new aspect of the character&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;that the troubled antagonist had been gay for years while imagining himself to be Norma. The revelation was such a groundbreaker that it&nbsp;even overshadowed&nbsp;Rihanna's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">appearance</a> in the show.</p><h2>Is&nbsp;Freddie Highmore&nbsp;Gay in Real Life?</h2><h2>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory <span>actor&nbsp;has been acting since a young age. But despite being in the scene for all these years, the 28-year-old prefers to keep personal life details under the wraps.</span></h2><p>There are no reports of marriage or current dating status. But over the years, the popular artist&nbsp;has been&nbsp;romantically linked to a few famous actresses.&nbsp;(Update: Highmore revealed he was <a href=# rel=follow>a married man</a>.)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Freddie first&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dated</a> Sarah Bolger back in 2006, which ended in 2009. They both starred in The Spiderwick Chronicles as siblings.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>There were also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumors</a> that Freddie had dated Dakota Fanning, Emma Roberts, and Abigail Breslin—all of whom are well-known actresses. However, these relationships have not been confirmed. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span>Fans Oblivious To </span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Freddie Highmore's<span>&nbsp;Personal Life</span></h2><p>Unlike his contemporaries, Freddie likes to stay out of the social media buzz.&nbsp;While the former child star does have an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram account</a>, it remains devoid of any updates or posts.</p><p>If only the <span>Good Doctor</span> star posted some glimpses into his hitherto concealed private life, the kissing scene from <span>Bates Motel </span>would probably not transpire&nbsp;all this unwarranted discussion on the actor's sexual preferences.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span>Regardless, Freddie prefers&nbsp;keeping personal details under the wraps, which is why he steers clear of social media. </span>According to the actor, the decision to stay out of such platforms is conscious&nbsp;and an effective one that&nbsp;helps him maintain a clear difference between his private and professional life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">Evening Standard</a>, the celeb talked about not getting involved with Twitter fans.&nbsp;</p><p>I just feel like it’s always helped me maintain a clear difference between your private life at home and then when you’re working and that side of things.I don’t have any of those, the Twitter or anything. Maybe I should just get some secret account somewhere and keep up to date with everything.”</p><p>Despite being thrown into the glamour and fame of Hollywood at an early age, the star hasn't let it all get to his head. In the same interview, Freddie said that he is thankful to family and friends for not letting him go down a cliched child actor route.&nbsp;</p><p>While unafraid to portray any kind of role on-screen, the beloved child actor remains humble and understandably private about his personal life—be it his sexuality or his relationships.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5u%2FprDDopxmoJmcta670Z6qZp%2BRrnqjrdOeqmaln6myrXrHraSl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gary-sanchez-mlb-stats-wife-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gary Snchez MLB Stats, Wife, Net Worth, Salary, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sally-field-ex-burt-reynolds-was-jealous-of-my-oscar-nod.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ex Burt Reynolds was jealous of my Oscar nod</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./277658-aj-johnson-aka-sharane-house-party-once-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./49ers-vaunted-defense-shredded-by-kirk-cousins-vikings.html>49ers vaunted defense shredded by Kirk Cousins, Vikings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./basketball-player-liangelo-ball-and-love-hip-hop-star-nikki-mudarris-expecting-first-child-together-photos.html>Basketball star LiAngelo Ball and Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop celebrity Nikki Mudarris are expecting their first</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-jeter-wont-actually-play-at-yankees-old-timers-day.html>Derek Jeter won't actually play at Yankees Old-Timers' Day</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./duct-tape-bikini-model-suffers-wardrobe-malfunction-during-nyfw.html>Duct tape bikini model suffers wardrobe malfunction during NYFW</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog.
