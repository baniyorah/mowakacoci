While surely some members of the LGBTQIA community feel corporations' willingness to hoist the pride flag every June is a sign of progress, others can't help but roll their eyes when suddenly major corporations' social media profiles and ads transform into a rainbow explosion of "YASS QUEEN!" every June 1.</p><p>The phenomenon is so ubiquitous now that it has sparked some hilarious <a href=#>memes</a> poking fun at the way companies respond to <a href=#>Pride Month</a> ‚Äî and how quickly things change back to business as usual on July 1.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">"Presto change-o, we're all gay now!" These memes smirk at the June 1 quick-change.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The inauthenticity and obvious pandering many companies engage in on their socials and in their ads is pretty embarrassing. It often makes you wonder if anyone who actually identifies as queer was involved in the decision making process for their Pride Month marketing strategy.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>This year the sudden change over to Gaylight Savings Time was made all the more jarring for its erasure of support for <a href=#>Ukraine</a>, whose <a href=#>occupation by Russia</a> certainly didn't end on June 1.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>On the left? That's an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actual post from the U.S. Marines</a>. That one on the right is a meme, but it isn't far off from the real thing.

For virtually every marginalized identity that gets their own designated "month," it's the same story. Companies flood the timeline with support for the Black community every February, followed by women in March, and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in May.</p><p>But rarely do the corporations do provide any tangible support to the challenges those communities face, and after the month is gone, they return to the status quo.</p><p>Anyway, Happy Pride!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGinaKiinrGmecyopa2gXZi8rrzAp6Ceq12isq6x0mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rb-singer-jill-scott-cuts-up-national-anthem-live-on-stage-with-anti-american-lyrics-blood-built-this-land.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>R&amp;amp;B singer Jill Scott blasts America during National Anthem performance: 'Blood built this land'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nigerian-american-man-shares-his-experience-after-mistaken-identity-arrest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Nigerian-American man shares his experience after mistaken identity arrest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./277658-aj-johnson-aka-sharane-house-party-once-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./49ers-vaunted-defense-shredded-by-kirk-cousins-vikings.html>49ers vaunted defense shredded by Kirk Cousins, Vikings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./basketball-player-liangelo-ball-and-love-hip-hop-star-nikki-mudarris-expecting-first-child-together-photos.html>Basketball star LiAngelo Ball and Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop celebrity Nikki Mudarris are expecting their first</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-jeter-wont-actually-play-at-yankees-old-timers-day.html>Derek Jeter won't actually play at Yankees Old-Timers' Day</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./duct-tape-bikini-model-suffers-wardrobe-malfunction-during-nyfw.html>Duct tape bikini model suffers wardrobe malfunction during NYFW</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog.
