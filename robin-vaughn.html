She recently became the center of media talks after she exploded on Saturday, 2nd May 2020, during city officials’ daily coronavirus briefing. Vaughn exploded into a homophobic tirade against the city’s mayor according to officials and audio of the call obtained by NJ Advance Media. Councilwoman Vaughn called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayor Reed Gusciora</a> a “pedophile.”</strong> <span id=more-559347></span></p><p>She also accused another city official, Joe Harrison of performing a sexual act on the city’s first openly gay mayor and called the mayor a “woman” and a “bitch a**.” In response to the unruly behavior, a prominent New Jersey group that advocates for LGBTQ rights came out to call on Vaughn to step down as West Ward councilwoman.
