Nothing even comes close.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Matt Leffers survived a vicious otter attack while swimming in a California lake in September.</figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Leffers was swimming in Serene Lakes in Placer County when otters began biting him. <span class=credit>KCRA</span></figure><p>He felt the first bite on his calf, and another just seconds later.</p><p>“And then I started swimming fast but there was the otter, popped up right in front of me and then I was bit again,” Leffers recalled.</p><p>The swimmer’s wife rescued him from the group of otters — known as a romp — on a paddleboard and then took him to a hospital to be treated for roughly 40 puncture wounds caused by the animals’ sharp teeth.</p><p>The otter mauling left the victim covered in scars – and seeing red. It came two months after an otter bit another swimmer in the same lake, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p><p>“I think the fact that I’m the second person attacked here this summer, it’s a big red flag,” Leffers said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Leffers was bitten at least 12 times and suffered roughly 40 puncture wounds caused by the furry assailants’ sharp teeth. <span class=credit>Courtesy Matt Leffers</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Leffers had to be rescued from the water by his wife and taken to the hospital. <span class=credit>Courtesy Matt Leffers</span></figure><p>He said he had been swimming in that lake, where his family owns a cabin, for 30 years and had never experienced anything like what happened to him in the familiar waters two months ago.</p><p>Peter Tira, a spokesperson for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, said that while otter attacks on people are very rare, they are a predator species.</p><p>“They won’t normally attack people or larger animals. However, they will defend their territory if they feel threatened, whether that’s a real threat or perceived threat,” Tira said.</p><p>Leffers called the agency’s response to the otter incident “wimpy” — and argued for the animals’ removal from the lake “before somebody gets killed.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">An otter attacked and bit another person in Serene Lakes in July. <span class=credit>Los Angeles Times via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Several otter attacks have been reported in recent months, including one in September, when <a href=#>a rabid otter bit a 74-year-old man</a> and a dog in Florida.</p><p>Just weeks earlier, three women were injured — and one of them<a href=#> lost a chunk of her right ear</a> — when an angry otter attacked them while they were tubing down a Montana river.</p><p>In July, a female otter made international headlines by <a href=#>snatching boards from surfers</a> near Santa Cruz, California, and repeatedly evaded capture.</p><p>In October, it was reported that the sneaky otter, dubbed “841”, had given birth to a pup and was seen floating with her baby resting on her belly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmaWtfo7K4v46srqKlnZq%2Fbq7Irauepl2Xxm67062cq6tdZn9uwMimnKxlmaN6pK3Lop2oqp6erm64wKScaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-ball-hard-by-lil-wayne.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Meaning Behind The Song: Ball Hard by Lil Wayne</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./patrick-schwarzenegger-engaged-to-girlfriend-abby-champion.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Patrick Schwarzenegger engaged to girlfriend Abby Champion</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./277658-aj-johnson-aka-sharane-house-party-once-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./49ers-vaunted-defense-shredded-by-kirk-cousins-vikings.html>49ers vaunted defense shredded by Kirk Cousins, Vikings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./basketball-player-liangelo-ball-and-love-hip-hop-star-nikki-mudarris-expecting-first-child-together-photos.html>Basketball star LiAngelo Ball and Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop celebrity Nikki Mudarris are expecting their first</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-jeter-wont-actually-play-at-yankees-old-timers-day.html>Derek Jeter won't actually play at Yankees Old-Timers' Day</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./duct-tape-bikini-model-suffers-wardrobe-malfunction-during-nyfw.html>Duct tape bikini model suffers wardrobe malfunction during NYFW</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog.
