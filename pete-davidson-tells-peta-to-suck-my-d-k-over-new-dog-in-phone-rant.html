29, told the organization to “suck my d – – k” after Senior Vice President of Cruelty Investigations&nbsp;Daphna Nachminovitch expressed disappointment in Davidson’s choice to shop rather than adopt, after being seen at an NYC pet shop.</p><p>“My mom’s f – – king dog, who is 2 years old, died a week before, so we’re all so sad, so I had to get a specific dog,” he said in a voicemail to Nachminovitch,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">obtained by TMZ</a>.</p><p>The “Saturday Night Live” alum shared that the dog was actually for his mother after the family dog, Henry, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recently passed away </a>prematurely.</p><p>He added that he’s “severely allergic” to dogs, which is why he had to get a Cavapoo — a mixed breed between the Cavalier King Charles spaniel and the poodle that’s hypoallergenic and considered a safe breed for allergy sufferers thanks to its low-shed coat, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AZ Animals</a>.</p><p>“So why don’t you do your research before you f – – king create news stories for people because you’re boring…” Davidson said in the voicemail, saying that the statement was “uneducated and premature.”</p><p>“F – – k you and suck my d – – k,” the comedian ended the phone call.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Pete Davidson, 29, told

would “show some big heart energy” and adopt rather than shop in the future.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Pete Davidson said that he’s “severely allergic” to

that Pete didn’t seek out a borough-born mutt from a city animal shelter, because a scrappy New Yorker with charm, personality and unconventional handsomeness could have been his perfect match,” Nachminovitch <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told TMZ</a> Monday.</p><p>But PETA doubled down, telling TMZ that there’s “no such thing as a hypoallergenic dog” and that he could have adopted the breed that he bought at an NYC pet store, which is something the “Bupkis” star didn’t know.</p><p>Davidson told TMZ that he was unaware he could “adopt a specific hypoallergenic dog” and that he was specifically told “it wasn’t an option, and if it was, it was rare.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Pete Davidson and girlfriend Chase Sui Wonders at an NYC pet shop. <span class=credit>citipupsnyc/Instagram</span></figure><p>He also told the outlet in a statement that his reaction came out of his grief over the loss of Henry.</p><p>“I haven’t seen my mom and sister cry like that in over 20 years. I was trying to cheer up my family,” Davidson said. “I was already upset that the store had filmed me without my permission or acknowledgment. Then this organization (PETA) made a public example of us, making our grieving situation worse.”</p><p>“I am upset. It was a poor choice of words. I shouldn’t have said what I said, but I am not sorry for standing up for myself and my family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29maW5fpbK1sYydmK%2BhlKi8r3nTnqOlq12lsrWtjK2mZqulmLhuudhmm2ajXaTDpr6Mp5ywZZSktG61zWanoaeemnqzrc2tZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pinecrest-high-school-stabdomain-7-victim-avery-slatcher.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pinecrest High School Stabbing Victim Avery Slatcher Parents And Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./north-korea-will-expel-us-army-defector-travis-king.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>North Korea will 'expel' US Army defector Travis King</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./277658-aj-johnson-aka-sharane-house-party-once-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./49ers-vaunted-defense-shredded-by-kirk-cousins-vikings.html>49ers vaunted defense shredded by Kirk Cousins, Vikings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./basketball-player-liangelo-ball-and-love-hip-hop-star-nikki-mudarris-expecting-first-child-together-photos.html>Basketball star LiAngelo Ball and Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop celebrity Nikki Mudarris are expecting their first</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-jeter-wont-actually-play-at-yankees-old-timers-day.html>Derek Jeter won't actually play at Yankees Old-Timers' Day</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./duct-tape-bikini-model-suffers-wardrobe-malfunction-during-nyfw.html>Duct tape bikini model suffers wardrobe malfunction during NYFW</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog.
