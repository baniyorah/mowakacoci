While the couple has remained relatively tight-lipped about their relationship, we have compiled all that we know about Bragg in one place.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>1. He Is a&nbsp;Professional Cinematographer</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Bragg’s IMDb <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">profile</a> lists him as a professional cinematographer with credits in the 2016 TV series Sheckler Sessions. Going by his profile, he seems like a one-man army since he was also the editor, director, and producer for the show.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>2. He Is an Adventure Junkie</h2><p>In The Nine Club <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">podcast</a>, Kelly’s beau discussed how, contrary to his expectations, his trip to South East Asia was an unbelievable adventure. Initially, he had planned to buy a bus and convert it into an RV and travel the lands.&nbsp;It turns out automobile purchase for non-Thai people was a pain.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>So he took a flight to Vietnam, bought a motorcycle, and headed north—no destination, just north. He claimed that they just rode till it was too dark to drive and then stayed with the locals in their homes! Oh! And&nbsp;he also swam in caves with bats. He did all this and more in his nine-month-long trip to Asia.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>3. Once Faked Winning a&nbsp;1.58 Billion Dollar Jackpot</h2><p>In January 2016, Bragg took to his Instagram to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announce</a> that he had the numbers from that week’s jackpot lottery winning him&nbsp;1.58 billion dollars.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Although many of his followers had called out his bluff, the post gathered over ninety-five thousand likes and eighty thousand comments by the next day. That jackpot was actually the largest lottery prize in history, as the previous twenty drawings yielded no winners.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Obviously, Bragg did not bag the lottery, but he drummed up a decent hype, though!&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>4. He Was a Pro-skateboarder but Would Rather Make His Money Elsewhere</h2><p>During the same podcast, the pro skateboarder from California disclosed that although he loved the sport of skateboarding, he would not like to do it as his primary income source. The host&nbsp;of the platform, Chris Roberts, couldn’t help but agree.&nbsp;</p><p>Roberts, a professional skateboarder himself, revealed that living off the earnings from skateboarding, that too in LA, was an enormous challenge. So much so that a half-decent skater might not even make rent or lease a car. Then again, both of them were on the same page when Roberts said that it was more about passion than money.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>5. He Is an Entrepreneur</h2><p>By now, this much is clear:&nbsp;Erik Bragg is an explorer. Staying true to his nature, when he was looking to buy a house, he got lost, and in the process, he found an opportunity. He ended on top of a hill overlooking the LA cityscape. Long story short, instead of a house, he ended up buying what would later be called Glass Mountain.&nbsp;</p><p>He has since been renting out the hill to agencies looking to shoot ads or photos. Jaden Smith, Ford, and Chevrolet are a few of the more recognizable people and brands that have used the site for filming.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKiloa6ze8SroKRlkqeuqLOMnq2eqqmptaq6xmaYm6elqXqssculsGano5e8tr7NnmSbp6mbv6qxzZ1loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./400038-who-is-michelle-shawn-rhodens-ex-and-the-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Michelle, Shawn Rhoden's Ex and the Mom of His Daughter?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./278693-wanda-sykes-married-future-mother-her-tw-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wanda Sykes Married Future Mother of Her Twins a Month before Publicly Coming Out</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./277658-aj-johnson-aka-sharane-house-party-once-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./49ers-vaunted-defense-shredded-by-kirk-cousins-vikings.html>49ers vaunted defense shredded by Kirk Cousins, Vikings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./basketball-player-liangelo-ball-and-love-hip-hop-star-nikki-mudarris-expecting-first-child-together-photos.html>Basketball star LiAngelo Ball and Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop celebrity Nikki Mudarris are expecting their first</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-jeter-wont-actually-play-at-yankees-old-timers-day.html>Derek Jeter won't actually play at Yankees Old-Timers' Day</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./duct-tape-bikini-model-suffers-wardrobe-malfunction-during-nyfw.html>Duct tape bikini model suffers wardrobe malfunction during NYFW</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog.
