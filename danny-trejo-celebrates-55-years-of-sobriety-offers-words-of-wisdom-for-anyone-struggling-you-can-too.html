I then got out of prison in 1969,” Trejo explained, sharing that he didn’t realize he’d ignored his underlying substance abuse issue before entering the program.</p><p>“I didn’t think turning me on to marijuana was abuse when I was 8. I thought it was sharing. It was a form of abuse. I didn’t know,” the actor shared. “So when you finally start realizing, ‘Wait a minute man, this is not right,’ that’s when the healing really begins.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Trejo in the 1996 action/horror film “From Dusk Till Dawn.” <span class=credit>X/officialDannyT</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Trejo as the bartender at Rocky’s bar, grill, and fine dining for the 2004 film “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.” <span class=credit>CBS via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Following his release in August 1969, the actor kept his promise to himself and God and stayed clean, ushering in over five decades of a flourishing acting career.</p><p>Since landing his first acting role in 1985’s “Runaway Train,” Trejo has 420 acting credits under his belt, according to the star’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb page</a>.</p><p>“I wake up every morning and say, ‘Dear heavenly Father, please let me help whoever I can for my fellow man. And I’ll say your name every day, and I’ll do whatever I can,’” Trejo shared.</p><p>His strong faith and guidance from God have not subsided in the years since his release, with the actor still keeping a dialogue with the higher power.</p><p>“He lived up to his deal. I’m living up to mine,” he told the outlet. “I even asked God a couple of days ago, ‘How am I doing?’ He said, ‘Trejo, you’re doing great. Keep it up. You’re almost out of hell.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fma21fma6vuthmq6udmqR6pLHLnpmrmaSawG6BlGawnpmiqHqwsoysppuqmZrBunnOn52eqqNixLC%2Bw6xkqJ5drLa0sM6mZJ%2BnomKur8XOp5xmq6Snwqizy6KloGWppMJur8CnZK2nn2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dorian-harewood-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dorian Harewood Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blake-shelton-to-host-barmageddon-with-pals-nikki-bella-carson-daly-after-retiring-as-the-voice-coach.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Blake Shelton to host 'Barmageddon' with pals Nikki Bella, Carson Daly after 'The Voice' exit</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./277658-aj-johnson-aka-sharane-house-party-once-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./49ers-vaunted-defense-shredded-by-kirk-cousins-vikings.html>49ers vaunted defense shredded by Kirk Cousins, Vikings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./basketball-player-liangelo-ball-and-love-hip-hop-star-nikki-mudarris-expecting-first-child-together-photos.html>Basketball star LiAngelo Ball and Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop celebrity Nikki Mudarris are expecting their first</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-jeter-wont-actually-play-at-yankees-old-timers-day.html>Derek Jeter won't actually play at Yankees Old-Timers' Day</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./duct-tape-bikini-model-suffers-wardrobe-malfunction-during-nyfw.html>Duct tape bikini model suffers wardrobe malfunction during NYFW</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog.
