However, that was not the only tragedy the family had to face. About five years before JonBenet's death, her older half-sister Elizabeth ‘Beth’ Pasch Ramsey died alongside her boyfriend Matthew Derrington on January 8, 1992, after they lost control of a BMW while accelerating on Interstate 55 and crashed into a truck.</p><p>In a conversation with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sun,</a> <a href=# rel>John Ramsey</a>, the father of JonBenet and Elizabeth, said, "It is the worst feeling in the world to lose a child - but the pain of losing two is simply indescribable." He narrated, "When I lost Beth, I got a call that she'd been killed. It was done. Over. I couldn't get her the best doctors, I couldn't comfort her, I couldn't do anything, it was over. That was really tough. But that was an accident in the middle of the day. They were on their way to a museum in Chicago and got hit by a truck. It was a horrible loss, but it was an accident. But what happened [to JonBenét] was not an accident. This was a vicious, creature - a subhuman creature who did this," he described.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>From JonBenet Ramsey to the Carnation Murders, shocking crimes that still haunt the US during Christmas</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Was JonBenet Ramsey a troubled child?
