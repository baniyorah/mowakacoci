A lucky Cohen is in isolation with his favorite person.</p><p class=Zg>The Bravo host has shared tons of pics so far of him and his boy bonding amid the coronavirus pandemic. While the latest post was no surprise, it was definitely welcomed by fans. The post is found below.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Andy Cohen attends the Tribeca talks panel during the 2018 Tribeca TV Festival at Spring Studios on September 23, 2018 in New York City. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>COHEN MATCHES IN PJ'S WITH BEN</strong></p><p class=Zg>"Three cheers for PJ Party!" Cohen <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CATvSmhBX_k/>captioned</a> the shot. In the pictures, the father-son duo wore matching pajama sets splattered with green leaves.</p><p class=Zg>The heartwarming duo appeared to be clapping their hands in both shots. Ben, 15 months, wore a toothy smile as he looked up at his dad in the first picture.</p><p class=Zg>In the second, Cohen looked down at him. The post received nearly 364k on the first day, with many of Cohen's celebrity colleagues commenting underneath.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>COHEN HAPPILY REUNITED WITH BEN</strong></p><p class=Zg>The "Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen" host recently <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/andy-cohen-coronavirus-reunited-with-son-ben-photo/>reunited</a> with his son after a nearly two-week stint in self-isolation when he tested positive for COVID-19.</p><p class=Zg>The separation was in March, and Cohen returned to living with his son at the end of the month. "I've hosted reunions for years, but yesterday's was the best one yet," he <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://people.com/parents/andy-cohen-coronavirus-reunited-with-son-ben-photo/>said</a> at the time.</p><p class=Zg>Soon enough, Ben might have a playmate around his own age. When things go back to normal, his father is hoping that Ben and Anderson Cooper's new son will be two peas in a pod.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>BEN AND WYATT TO BE BFF'S</strong></p><p class=Zg>The reporter welcomed his first child earlier this month. Responding to a comment made on Instagram, Cohen <a class="zd d" href=#>approved</a> the suggestion that Ben and Wyatt would be best friends.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Andy Cohen giving a thumbs up on his Instagram Story | Photo: Instagram/@andycohen</p><p class=Zg>Before that, Cohen had commented underneath Cooper's post announcing the new members of his family. "I know a friend who can't wait to meet you!" he reportedly <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/parents/andy-cohen-says-his-son-ben-anderson-cooper-s-son-t181209>wrote</a>.</p><p class=Zg>Ben and Wyatt already have something in common, apart from their famous dads. During his Sirius XM radio show, Cohen <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/andy-cohen-son-ben-nanny-now-anderson-cooper-son-wyatt-nanny/>revealed</a> that his son's former nanny is now the nanny for Cooper's child.</p><p class=Zg>Fans of "Radio Andy" guessed as much when Cohen kept saying that the woman was leaving him to go and help a friend of his. Cohen noted that they took precautions during the process because of COVID-19.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>COHEN DENIED ABILITY TO DONATE</strong></p><p class=Zg>While most things are going right for the entertainer, there's also some bad news to share.

Furthermore, gay men have to abstain from sex for three months before donations.</p><p class=Zg>Cohen noted that no such rules existed for straight individuals, and questioned the logic applied in the protocols. He lamented the lack of adaptation as he explained that all he wanted was to save a life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtncmtgZXqiusOyZJynmJq7brTIrGSsp55ir6a6yZqkoqZdpby0sYymmK2bmJ67b7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dan-olah-obituary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bad News!
