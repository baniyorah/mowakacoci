Loki also features Owen Wilson, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Richard E. Grant, and &nbsp;Sophia Di Martino. Now, we've learned that another popular actress has joined the cast as 'Miss Minutes'.</p><p>The show follows Loki's adventures with the <a href=# rel>Time Variance Authority</a> (TVA), a bureaucratic institution whose role is to ensure the "proper flow of time" in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The show has spawned a large number of fan theories, most notably the character of Di Martino. Marvel hasn't announced her role, leaving many fans to speculate she could be playing <a href=# rel>Lady Loki</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Loki' Full Cast List: Meet Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson, Gugu Mbatha-raw and rest of the stars of Disney Plus show</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Loki' casts 'Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice' actress Wunmi Mosaku in the Disney+ series</a></p><p>Episode 1 ends with Mobius (Owen Wilson) <a href=# rel>telling Loki</a> he needs his help to catch a 'variant' which could be Di Martino's character as many have speculated. With fans enjoying Easter eggs along the way, one particular egg that they seemed to love was Miss Minutes, the mascot of the TVA.</p><h2 class=split>Who plays Miss Minutes?</h2><p>While not a prominent role, Miss Minutes is bound to be a recurring character in the show. In Episode 1, she brings a very confused Loki up to speed about where he is and why he is at the TVA. The hilarious scene got many people talking, mostly about the voice of Miss Minutes. There was no formal announcement about who would play the lovable orange clock, but Marvel did spill the beans in the credits of the show.&nbsp;</p><p>Miss Minutes is <a href=# rel=nofollow>voiced by</a> Canadian actress Tara Strong, who is well known for her voice work. Strong has voiced Harley Quinn, Barbara Gordon, and Poison Ivy in numerous DC video games and animations. She's also cast as Raven on 'Teen Titans GO!' Strong is also no stranger to Marvel, having voiced Mary Jane Watson and the Scarlet Witch in some cartoons in the past. Strong's voice work goes back to the late 1980s, and she's been involved in some pretty popular projects. These include 'X-Men', 'The Powerpuff Girls', 'Family Guy', 'Samurai Jack', and numerous 'Ben 10' shows. She's also appeared in films like 'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker', 'The Secret Life of Pets', 'Ted', 'Bolt', and 'Ice Age'.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Deserter News</a>, 'Loki' director Kate Herron said, "Miss Minutes is kind of like our ‚ÄòJurassic Park‚Äô Mr. DNA. I think she‚Äôs definitely very helpful because she‚Äôs kind of explaining this really cool new part of the MCU we‚Äôre setting up. Beyond that, I think she‚Äôs just a really fun character. You know, she‚Äôs like one of our main cast in the TVA. I‚Äôm excited for everyone to see more of her."&nbsp; The orange animated clock is expected to feature in more episodes, judging by Herron's own words. As to whether she will return to other Marvel productions, only time will tell.&nbsp;</p><p>With a Southern accent. Strong has certainly made her mark on MCU fans. Her MCU debut has got people talking and it seems like Miss Minutes has quickly become a fan favorite just one episode in. Here's what Twitter had to say about her casting.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Twitter's 'favorite part'</h2><p>"Hearing Miss Minutes from Loki is voiced by Tara Strong, meaning Tara Strong is in the MCU, is such an awesome thing to learn.
