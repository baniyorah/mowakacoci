So I’m gonna leave it just like that.’ That’s really me nervous singing on that song, but it seemed to work out.”</p><p>Now, though, busting those synchronized dance moves night after night comes with a post-concert cost.</p><p>“A lot more massages after the show, a whole lot more rubbing on the knees with certain ointments,” said DeVoe. “But we wouldn’t trade any of the stuff that we have to go through off the stage for that feeling that we get when we’re on.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">New Edition’s debut album, “Candy Girl,” was released on July 19, 1983.</figure><p>Just don’t expect them to crush “Candy Girl” and other <a href=#>NE</a> classics quite the same way as they did before their voices changed.</p><p>“The key of the song might not be in A — it might be a little bit more like M, O or P,” said DeVoe with a laugh. “We gotta lower ’em a little bit, because it’s a challenge to hit those notes that we did when we were 12 and 13 years of age.</p><p>“But,” he added, “[we bring] the same energy that we sang them with back in the day when we see the faces of the people that are standing on their feet from the start of the show to the end.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmam9fo7K4ecSdoK2hn6N6tMDIpaNmrJ%2Bqv6q6xmZraWWpmq6zv4yana2domKworrDsmSgoaKhfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-bob-gable-obituary-cherished-resident-of-okeechobee-florida-has-died.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Robert Bob Gable Obituary, Cherished Resident Of Okeechobee, Florida Has Died</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./moodie-siblings-viral-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Moodie Siblings viral video: the shocking disappearance and tragic fate of Kerrick and Keneisha Mood</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./277658-aj-johnson-aka-sharane-house-party-once-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./49ers-vaunted-defense-shredded-by-kirk-cousins-vikings.html>49ers vaunted defense shredded by Kirk Cousins, Vikings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./basketball-player-liangelo-ball-and-love-hip-hop-star-nikki-mudarris-expecting-first-child-together-photos.html>Basketball star LiAngelo Ball and Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop celebrity Nikki Mudarris are expecting their first</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-jeter-wont-actually-play-at-yankees-old-timers-day.html>Derek Jeter won't actually play at Yankees Old-Timers' Day</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./duct-tape-bikini-model-suffers-wardrobe-malfunction-during-nyfw.html>Duct tape bikini model suffers wardrobe malfunction during NYFW</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog.
