GoFundMe page for Ralph Yarl, the 16-year-old boy <a href=#>who was shot in the head</a> for ringing the wrong doorbell in Missouri, has raised more than $2.8 million as of Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>The fundraiser, launched by the teen’s aunt, has drawn nearly 75,000 donors to help pay for his medical expenses after he was shot twice by <a href=#>suspect Andrew Lester, 84</a>, in Kansas City.</p><p>The GoFundMe page will raise money for Yarl’s medical bills and therapy, with any additional money going to his college fund and other expenses.</p><p>His aunt, Faith Spoonmore, noted that it is Yarl’s dream to attend Texas A&M University to study chemical engineering after visiting the school last summer.</p><p>Yarl has since been discharged from the hospital and is recovering at home, with <a href=#>Lester officially charged on Monday with assault in the first degree</a> and armed criminal action, according to the Clay County Prosecutor’s office.</p><p>Lester shot Yarl twice — once in the head and once in the arm — with a .32-caliber revolver after the teen mistakenly arrived on his doorstep on Thursday night to pick up his twin brothers who were actually waiting for him at a home about a block away.</p><p>Prosecutor Zachary Thompson added that there was “a racial component” to the case, given that Lester is white and Yarl was black.</p><p>But he did not elaborate, only saying no words were exchanged between the two before Yarl was blasted.</p><p>Earlier on Monday, it was revealed that there were signs warning against solicitors and trespassers at the home where Yarl was shot.</p><p>A small sign right above the doorbell Yarl rang reads,&nbsp;<a href=#>“No Solicitors,”</a>&nbsp;and another sign by the side fence states: “This property is protected by surveillance cameras.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The GoFundMe page for Ralph Yarl has raised more than $2.8 million as of Tuesday afternoon.

said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Andrew Lester, 84, allegedly shot Yarl in the head and in the arm with a .32-caliber revolver after the teen

breaking into his home, which would play into Missouri’s “Stand your ground” law.</p><p>According to the state’s self-defense law, a person may use physical and deadly force against another if they have a reason to believe that such force is necessary to protect “against death, serious physical injury or any forcible felony.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image

play into the case as Lester was inside his house when he fired at Yarl, who was standing outside.</p><p>It remains to be seen if Lester will be able to argue that he faced a legitimate threat when Yarl rang his doorbell.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">James Lynch found Yarl unconscious right after he was shot, according to reports.</figure><figure
