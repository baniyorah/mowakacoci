The woman has been identified as 29-year-old Michelle Kerry Edoo. The five who were working at the mall overdosed on cocaine laced with fentanyl. Following Edoo's death, two people have been taken into custody.</p><p>The Bergenfield native, who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, died from <a href=# rel>fentanyl poisoning</a> last Saturday, March 18, 2023, three days after she and four other workers at the Riverside mall were found in the lower level of the parking garage. Except for Edoo, the other four workers survived, reported <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">New York Post</a>.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Sick' Joe Biden slammed for laughing while discussing brothers who died of fentanyl overdose</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Nathan Millard: Georgia dad of five was looking for 'a girl' before drug overdose and death</a></p><h2 class=split>What happened on the day that led to Edoo's death?</h2><p>The group of five was unaware that the cocaine they were consuming contained dangerous amounts of the opioid fentanyl, said Bergen prosecutors. Before the arrival of first responders who administered Narcan, the overdose-reversing medicine, the women received CPR from Good Samaritans who found them. Out of all the victims aged between 29 to 41, four of them were shifted to the <a href=#>Hackensack</a> University Medical Center, while a fifth victim declined medical treatment and remained at the scene.</p><h2 class=split>Edoo leaves behind her daughter</h2><p>Edoo was remembered as a loving mother to her daughter, Ava. The online fundraiser created by her family to support her daughter read, "More than anything, Michelle worshipped her daughter Ava and took pride in telling anyone who would listen about how captivating she is," and described her as "always laughing, smiling."</p><p>"She always supported and pushed the people she loved and cared for their dreams. She spoke with genuine love and compassion for anyone she spoke with and was always willing to help with a loving hand or a listening ear," the tribute added. Edoo who worked full-time at the mall had just enrolled in a nursing school.</p><h2 class=split>Police arrested two men in connection to Edoo's death</h2><p>In connection to the overdoses, authorities took two men into custody from Paterson, New Jersey. Garfield Jones, 48, was arrested and charged with third-degree possession of a controlled substance and third-degree possession with the intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance. Robert McCrae, 52, who was also arrested on Friday was charged with fourth-degree possession with the intent to distribute drug paraphernalia and third-degree possession with the intent to distribute less than a half-ounce of heroin.</p><p>At a press conference on Friday, March 24, Bergen County Prosecutor Mark Musella said, "We are here to sound the alarm. The death is due to the fentanyl that is pouring into our communities, killing our friends and killing our family members," reported <a href=# rel=nofollow>NJ.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopZmYtaa4y55knpyfpHq4u8yapWacmZrAbrXNZqSapJxivaK%2ByqKloGWcpMFurcWtnKtln6uys7DOrKCnn12ku26vzpyYoqaVYrmir8SdZJ%2Bdnqmur8XLZmlmmaKnsrTAxJ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./netta-barzilai.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Netta Barzilai Net Worth - Wiki, Age, Weight and Height, Relationships, Family, and More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maine-mass-shooting-suspect-robert-card-found-dead-after-two-day-manhunt.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maine mass shooting suspect Robert Card found dead after two-day manhunt: sources</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./277658-aj-johnson-aka-sharane-house-party-once-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./49ers-vaunted-defense-shredded-by-kirk-cousins-vikings.html>49ers vaunted defense shredded by Kirk Cousins, Vikings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./basketball-player-liangelo-ball-and-love-hip-hop-star-nikki-mudarris-expecting-first-child-together-photos.html>Basketball star LiAngelo Ball and Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop celebrity Nikki Mudarris are expecting their first</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-jeter-wont-actually-play-at-yankees-old-timers-day.html>Derek Jeter won't actually play at Yankees Old-Timers' Day</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./duct-tape-bikini-model-suffers-wardrobe-malfunction-during-nyfw.html>Duct tape bikini model suffers wardrobe malfunction during NYFW</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog.
