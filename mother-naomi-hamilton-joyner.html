(Mark 10:51).&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the burden another carried and offered to help with the load.&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the spirit of&nbsp;Naomi!</p><p>Now this beautiful servant, can rest!&nbsp;&nbsp;Well done, thou good and faithful servant.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have finished the course&nbsp;and kept the faith!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the gates of heaven where there is a place Jesus has prepared for you!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillam%2FsLzOpaCtmZ6bwq%2Bx0ZqjrJ2iq7aksY2cpqZnnZq6sL7ImqNopZ%2Bptaa%2BjKeYqKWZYrWiucilq6imXZ%2B8urrEq2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./maryum-ali.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Muhammad Ali's eldest Daughter, Maryum Ali is enjoying her Single life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mario-winans-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mario Winans Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./277658-aj-johnson-aka-sharane-house-party-once-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./49ers-vaunted-defense-shredded-by-kirk-cousins-vikings.html>49ers vaunted defense shredded by Kirk Cousins, Vikings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./basketball-player-liangelo-ball-and-love-hip-hop-star-nikki-mudarris-expecting-first-child-together-photos.html>Basketball star LiAngelo Ball and Love &amp;amp;
