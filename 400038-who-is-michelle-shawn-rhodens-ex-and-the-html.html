Before his death, he had married and divorced Michelle Sugar. He and his former wife welcomed one child together.</p><p class=dh>Little is known about the time before or during their marriage. However, the pair's Instagram pages are filled with snaps from their lives. One of the things the couple is proud of is their daughter, Cora, whom they show so much love toward.</p><p class=dh>There is only a little information publicly available about Sugar except what is on her social media. According to her Instagram, she is a business owner who runs a salon in Santa Barbara. She recently started dating a guy called Richie, and the two appear to be deeply in love.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>The Mom of Shawn's Daughter Is an Entrepreneur</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Not much is known about Rhoden and Sugar's time together besides that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/news/4015692/who-is-shawn-rhodens-ex-wife-michelle/>they married</a> in 2018. Their marriage did not last long, though, as allegations of infidelity and other personal issues troubled their matrimony, leading to divorce shortly after.</p><p class=dh>Despite only getting married in 2018, the couple had been together for several years before that. In July 2015, they welcomed their one and only child, a daughter named Cora.</p><p class=dh>According to her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/michelle_sugarsb/>Instagram account</a>, which boasts over 15.9k followers, Sugar is a businesswoman who owns a salon called Sugar in Santa Barbara, California. The shop is an all-natural hair removing salon.</p><p class=dh>The salon mainly focuses on full-body sugaring, which removes body hair with a wax-like substance. The substance is made from sugar and several other natural ingredients.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Shawn Is Survived by His Daughter Cora</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Rhoden left behind a daughter who he adored and who adored him back. His social media is filled with posts of the father-daughter duo enjoying each other's company. In a post on July 23, 2021, about four months before <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2021/11/06/mr-olympia-bodybuilding-champ-shawn-rhoden-dead-at-46-after-reported-heart-attack/>he died</a>, Rhoden shared photos of himself and his daughter for her sixth birthday. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CRrnocDhReb/>captioned</a> it:</p><p class=dh>"With a blink of an eye time stood still and you were here. I Still remembered your first cry, holding you in my arms with tears in my eyes and scared of what the future might be. You have been my inspiration and motivation, my reason for living for breathing (sic)."</p><p class=dh>Some photos on Cora's father's Instagram page include one where they were dressed in their <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CVon_8ppIYF/>Halloween costume</a> in 2021. A week before his death, Rhoden shared a photo of the pair embracing, with a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CVtMvVZhiGO/>caption</a>, "Life Is Not Measured By the Number of Breaths We Take. But By the Moments That Take out Breath Away <i class=ch>(sic)</i>."</p><p class=dh>Although they had separated, Sugar continued to pay homage to her late former husband. In August 2022, she posted photos of herself with Cora in the gym where she had met Rhoden. The post included a sweet caption, part of which was dedicated to the late bodybuilder. It <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/ChSIRW4Lkhi/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"It only took 30 photos & holding my breath for minutes on end to shoot the shotðŸ˜‰, Shout out to Shawnyyyyy! RIP @flexatronrhoden may your abs be both mine & many others forever goals! Glad I took Cora back to see where we met, your favorite spot and to see you in all your glory!"</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>His Ex, Michelle, Seems to Be in a New Relationship</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Rhoden -- who won the Mr. Olympia title 48 years after <a class="me a" href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> -- and Sugar's marriage ended in divorce, and his death only came after the divorce. It is unclear if any of them had moved on after their separation while both were still alive.</p><p class=dh>However, several months after Rhoden's unfortunate passing, Sugar shared photos of her new man. On October 28, 2022, she shared pictures of them kissing along with a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CkPMCphJetN/>message</a>, "If ya [sic] don't know, now ya [sic] know."</p><p class=dh>To say she seems excited about the relationship could be an understatement. The salon owner is head over heels for her new lover, who seems like he fell straight out of a magazine, making the duo a picture-perfect couple.</p><p class=dh>Not much is publicly known about the mysterious man except that his name is Richie. He owns two barbershops, Richie's Barber Shop in Montecito and Isla Vista in California. Sugar seems to have a thing for muscular men as Richie looks like he is a regular in the heavy weight lifting side of the gym.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1naWhjbXq4tM5moKxlnZ6wqbHLpZxmq5iWxK950aGmnZ2eqHqmxIyapZ1lpJ2yb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-shya-lamour-10-facts-bout-her-scandal-with-cardi-bs-husband.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Shya L'amour? 10 Facts About Her, Scandal With Cardi Bs Husband</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./erik-bragg-everything-about-kelly-osbourne-boyfriend-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Erik Bragg?
