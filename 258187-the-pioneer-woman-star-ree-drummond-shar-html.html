In a sneak peek of Drummond’s new book entitled “Frontier Follies,” the blogger took the time to share her sentiments in welcoming a new family member to the fold.</p><p class=Fg>With Jamar as their first foster son, Drummond held back on exposing too much information given state agency rules. The American blogger didn’t want to subject her new son to the usual social media spotlight, citing the importance of her adoptive son’s creation of his own story.</p><p class=Fg>However, since Jamar’s recent entry to legal age, no more agency regulations apply, allowing the Drummonds to post about him on social media. The Oklahoma native also recalled the first time she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/ree-drummond-life/a34305465/ree-foster-son-jamar/>met Jamar.</a></p><p class=Fg>It was a quick exchange where both said hello, and the 52-year-old offered her kids’ good friend a cookie. Now, he’s one of them. It’s a beautiful realization that such a short and straightforward encounter could turn into the family’s growth.</p><p class=Fg>In a recent Instagram post, Drummond took the opportunity to share an amazing photo capturing all of her <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/ree-drummond-kids-meet-the-pioneer-womans-4-children/&nbsp;>children</a> during Easter Sunday, whom she referred to as her “Easter Squad,” together with her.</p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>The cooking star later gave a health update for fans on her website and social media.</strong></h3><p class=Fg>With their Sunday’s best on, everyone were all smiles. Beyond the occasion, the get-together was a great reminder for the “Pioneer Woman” star’s greatest blessing in life. “Not sure how Ladd and I got so lucky, but we’ll take it. I love these pookie heads so much,” she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CNQripeM09Y/>wrote</a>.</p><p class=Fg>As a mother of a growing family, the “Food Network” star has certainly adapted to the instincts of an always-ready parent. In a recent interview, Drummond shared the details of a fire truck crash that injured both her nephew, Caleb, and her husband, Ladd.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/bda31aaf378baef408e6faef3a2776d8.jpeg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Ree Drummond and Ladd Drummond photo during The Pioneer Woman Magazine Celebration event at The Mason Jar on June 6, 2017 in New York City. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>The Oklahoma Department of Public Safety highlighted that Caleb went into a <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/03/10/pioneer-woman-ree-drummond-nephew-critical-condition-after-crash/6948748002/>critical condition</a> after suffering multiple injuries. While Ladd refused to get on-site treatment, it was later discovered that he had also fractured his neck.</p><p class=Fg>“I guess if you’ve lived enough years as a wife, mother, sister, daughter, you’re going to develop the ability to power through crises without crumbling,” Drummond <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/ree-drummond-life/a35833934/home-sweet-home-and-so-grateful/>said</a> as she pointed out the importance of facing the unexpected.</p><p class=Fg>Despite refusing to be treated by paramedics on the scene, <a class="Xd a" href=#>Ladd</a> eventually underwent surgery for his neck fracture and had to wear a neck brace during their daughter Alex’s wedding.</p><p class=Fg>The cooking star later gave a health update for fans on her website and social media, thanking her community for the kindness and well wishes they have been sending for her family’s recovery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtscWlobHq1tMRmp6Knnpqys3nWqKSapl2owaK%2BjKucnmWUp8Kuuc6nm2armJa%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./94287-living-single-erika-alexander-tc-carson-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Living Single's Erika Alexander and TC Carson share pic together on the show's 25th anniversary</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./your-thanksgiving-meal-is-worth-several-days-of-calories.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Your Thanksgiving meal is worth several days of calories</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./277658-aj-johnson-aka-sharane-house-party-once-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./49ers-vaunted-defense-shredded-by-kirk-cousins-vikings.html>49ers vaunted defense shredded by Kirk Cousins, Vikings</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./basketball-player-liangelo-ball-and-love-hip-hop-star-nikki-mudarris-expecting-first-child-together-photos.html>Basketball star LiAngelo Ball and Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop celebrity Nikki Mudarris are expecting their first</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-jeter-wont-actually-play-at-yankees-old-timers-day.html>Derek Jeter won't actually play at Yankees Old-Timers' Day</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./duct-tape-bikini-model-suffers-wardrobe-malfunction-during-nyfw.html>Duct tape bikini model suffers wardrobe malfunction during NYFW</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog.
